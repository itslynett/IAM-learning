# 🔐 Cloud Security Summer 2025 – Week 1: IAM Lab

## 📚 Overview
This hands-on lab explores the basics of Identity and Access Management (IAM) across AWS and Azure environments. It simulates a real-world task: securing access for a multi-cloud development team.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Understand core IAM concepts: users, groups, roles, permissions
- Apply least privilege access across AWS IAM and Azure AD
- Build and test custom policies/roles
- Compare cloud-specific access controls

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- AWS IAM Console + CLI
- Azure Active Directory Portal
- IAM Policy Simulator
- LearnCantrill.io Sandbox (for AWS Labs)

## 💡 What I Learned
- How AWS IAM uses JSON-based policies to control access
- How Azure AD implements role-based access control (RBAC)
- Differences in role creation and assignment across platforms
- Risks of over-permissioning and importance of scoped access
